## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers to understand and interact with human language. This project utilizes two popular libraries:

- **SpaCy:** A Python library for advanced NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and text summarization.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** A library providing pre-trained models and pipelines for various NLP tasks, including question answering.
